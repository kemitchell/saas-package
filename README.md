# SaaS Passport

adaptable standard terms for software as a service

## Be Warned!

***Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for selling your service, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions.  There's no harm in telling them about SaaS Passport.  They may decide it fits your needs.***

***Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your product, or your customers in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  Nobody dumb enough to fall for that will be a good source of advice.***

## Deal Packet

A deal on SaaS Passport terms is made up of a few documents:

-  An [_Order Form_](./order.md) listing deal-specific terms, for negotiation by businesspeople

-  A _Rider_ adding vendor-specific terms and optionally incorporating one or more _Add-Ons_, for negotiation by lawyers

-  [_Base Terms_](./base.md) setting out invariant legal terms, which remain fixed across vendors and deals

## Add-Ons

Add-ons supplement the base terms with template obligations of various kinds.  Riders can then fill in the details, or rely on the add-on's defaults.

- [_Patent_](./patent.md) to supplement the standard patent-risk compromise in the base terms with warranty and indemnity for all patent infringement from covered use of the service

- [_Uptime_](./uptime.md) for service-uptime service-level agreements

- [_Support_](./support.md) for more detailed technical support commitments, with response time service-level agreements

- [_Insurance_](./insurance.md) requires the vendor to carry a slate of insurance

- [_Arbitration_](./arbitration.md) commits the parties to settle disputes by arbitration

- [_Publicity_](./publicity.md) gives the provider permission to reference the customer to leads, and in promo materials
