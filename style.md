# Contract Drafting Style

## Terms
- Use "Provider" for the vendor.  Do not put "the" before "Provider".
- Use "Customer" for the customer.  Do not put "the" before "Customer".
- Use "Service" for the service.  Put "the" before "Service".

## Formulations
- Express obligations with "agrees to".
- Always use "then" after "if".
- Use "side" to refer to parties, as in "both sides" and "neither side".
- For default terms, use either:
  - "does not say", as in "If the Order Form does not say, then ..."
  - "Unless ... says otherwise", as in "Unless the Rider says otherwise..."
- To refer to terms from other documents, use "listed on", as in "listed on the Order Form".
