# SaaS Passport

adaptable standard terms for software as a service

## Deal Packet

A deal on SaaS Passport terms is made up of a few documents:

-  An _Order Form_ listing deal-specific terms, for negotiation by businesspeople

-  A _Rider_ adding vendor-specific terms and optionally incorporating one or more _Add-Ons_, for negotiation by lawyers

-  _Base Terms_ setting out invariant legal terms, which remain fixed across vendors and deals

## Add-Ons

Add-ons supplement the base terms with template obligations of various kinds.  Riders can then fill in the details, or rely on the add-on's defaults.

- _Patent_ to supplement the standard patent-risk compromise in the base terms with warranty and indemnity for all patent infringement from covered use of the service

- _Uptime_ for service-uptime service-level agreements

- _Support_ for more detailed technical support commitments, with response time service-level agreements

- _Insurance_ requires the vendor to carry a slate of insurance

- _Arbitration_ commits the parties to settle disputes by arbitration

- _Publicity_ gives the provider permission to reference the customer to leads, and in promo materials
