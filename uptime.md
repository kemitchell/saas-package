# Ensure Service Levels
## Service-Level Agreement
So long as _Customer_'s use of the _Service_ remains within the _Use Limits_, _Provider_ agrees to host the _Service_ with _Uptime_ of no less than the **Uptime Commitment** listed on the _Rider_. If the _Rider_ does not say, the _Uptime Commitment_ is `Default Uptime Commitment`.

## Give Credits for Low Uptime
_Provider_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account on _Notice_ and verification that _Provider_ failed to provide service according to [Service-Level Agreement](#Service-Level_Agreement) in the current _Billing Period_ or any of the `Uptime SLA Lookback Periods` prior _Billing Periods_, according to the _Rider_. If the _Rider_ does not say, _Provider_ agrees to credit _Customer_'s account:

- `First Uptime SLA Credit Percentage` of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between zero and one percentage point less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- `Second Uptime SLA Credit Percentage` of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ between one and two percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

- `Third Uptime SLA Credit Percentage` of _Fees_ for any _Billing Period_ with _Uptime_ at or below three percentage points less than the _Uptime Commitment_

## Apply Credits
_Provider_ agrees to apply credits under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#Give_Credits_for_Low_Uptime) against _Customer_'s obligations to pay _Fees_ as soon as possible. _Provider_ does not agree to refund any credits.

## Refund Fees for Low Uptime
If _Provider_ credits _Customer_'s account under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#Give_Credits_for_Low_Uptime) for `Uptime SLA Lookback Periods` _Billing Periods_ in a row, and _Customer_ ends this agreement at the end of those _Billing Periods_, citing low _Uptime_, _Provider_ agrees to refund all _Fees_ that _Customer_ paid for the `Uptime SLA Lookback Periods` _Billing Periods_, as well as any _Prepaid Fees_.

# Agreed Legal Remedy
_Customer_'s only legal remedies for failures to meet [Service-Level Agreement](#Service-Level_Agreement) will be credits under [Give Credits for Low Uptime](#Give_Credits_for_Low_Uptime) and refunds under [Refund Fees for Low Uptime](#Refund_Fees_for_Low_Uptime).
